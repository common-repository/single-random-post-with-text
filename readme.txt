This plugin adds a new cover for the old content of your blog.


== Description ==

You can bring on the first page or any other page, for the new visitors, the old content.It's no need of the question why should I do this because you want that your visitors could have in their view your older articles.

What does this plugin bring new?

Other plug-ins are already doing a great job about random posts, but for me was not important to show just a list of a few links to my articles; not just a random generated list, with some titles. For some new visitors, the article's content is more important than the title, actually, for anybody this statement  is true .
So, I created this plugin to mark out even some text from the random article.
